### Project Overview
### Data Sources
### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. Data Cleaning
  2. Analysis
  3. Visualization
- SQL - Structured Query Language for querying of data
- Github for Portfolio building
To create indentations, just put hyphen in front of your lines, and for the next set of indentation, you can use numbering.
If you do not put hyphens, you list will be written in a block of statement/paragraph.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formating

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves the exploration of data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which product are top sellers?
- What are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries, or even some of the DAX expressions used during analysis. 

To write a code, we must start and end with 3 dots as seen below

... SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
...

There are various syntaxes that can be used in Github, for instance;
2 stars in front, your character in between and two stars at the end is BOLD syntax
1 start, your character and one star at the end is the ITALICS syntax
