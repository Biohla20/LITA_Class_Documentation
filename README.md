### Project Overview
Insert anything

### Data Sources
Insert anything

### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. Data Cleaning
  2. Analysis
  3. Visualization
- SQL - Structured Query Language for querying of data
- Github for Portfolio building
To create indentations, just put hyphen in front of your lines, and for the next set of indentation, you can use numbering.
If you do not put hyphens, you list will be written in a block of statement/paragraph.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formating

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves the exploration of data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which product are top sellers?
- What are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries, or even some of the DAX expressions used during analysis. 

To write a code, we must start and end with 3 dots as seen below

... SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
...

There are various syntaxes that can be used in Github, for instance;
2 stars in front, your character in between and two stars at the end is BOLD syntax,
1 star in front, your character and one star at the end is the ITALICS syntax


### How to upload or attach a document or visuals
Click on repository name, it takes you back to the home page, click on the + sign beside Go to file tab, click upload file and follow other instructions.

### Data Visualization
Put in your images here, go to your folder, click and drag and drop.

If you want to be artistic with your work, press the full colon : and try to type what you want, and this will give you a list of emojis you can add to your work 
ðŸ¥‡

You can also create a table by yourself, using the pipe symbols | as seen below, the dashes closes the heading columns

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3|
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Table 1   | Table 2   | Table 3  |

You can create an outline of headings and put it immediately after the project title, this will help you when working so as not to keep scrolling down a very long page of work done. See outline up this page.

To do the outlines, open a square bracket, copy and paste your headings exactly the way it is typed on your document and close the square bracket, then open a parentesis, insert #, write the headings in small caps, use hyphen - to create space in the headings and then close the parentesis.

### Introduction
A message popped up on a RCCG youths' WhatsApp group and it was a free training for ladies seeking knowledge in tech. I did not hesistate to jump on the wagon. I filled the application and the rest is story. Thanks for the initiative brought about by Pastor Folu'Adeboye in conjuction with The Incubator Hub and Ladies In Tech Africa (LITA).

### Microsoft Excel
Before the data analysis course began, I could do basic data entry using Excel and that is about it. Thanks to the detailed instructor in person of Hameed Muhsin (ID), he made learning Excel come easy. Below are some of the highlights from the three weeks of intensive teachings, including class notes and class work. 

The most important of the highlights for me is his quote by Brian Herbert, which says, **"the capacity to learn is a gift, the ability to learn is a skill, and the willingness to learn is a choice."** I am glad that I made the choice to learn.
